# Given an array of distinct integers, find length of the longest subarray which contains numbers that can be arranged in a continuous sequence. 
#  Input:  arr[] = {10, 12, 11};
#  Output: Length of the longest contiguous subarray is 3
#
#  Input:  arr[] = {14, 12, 11, 20};
#   Output: Length of the longest contiguous subarray is 2
# 
#   Input:  arr[] = {1, 56, 58, 57, 90, 92, 94, 93, 91, 45};
#   Output: Length of the longest contiguous subarray is 5
